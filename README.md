# 🎙️ Virtual Assistant with NLP in Python

This project implements a **virtual assistant system** developed from scratch using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts in Python.  
The assistant is capable of interpreting user commands, executing automated actions, and responding using synthesized speech.

Due to environment limitations, this version is fully compatible with **Google Colab**.
